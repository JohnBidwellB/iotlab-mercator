This repository is organized as follows:

* `datasets/` contains a collection of connectivity datasets.
* `locations/` contains the locations of all the motes, grouped by deployment site.
* `code/` contains the firmware run on the motes, and the scripts to run an experiment. All experiments are run on the [IoT-LAB testbeds](https://www.iot-lab.info/).

Navigate into each directory for more detailed information. You will find the source code of the web interface at `https://openwsn-berkeley.github.io/aila/` in the `gh-pages` branch of this repository.
