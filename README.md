**Mercator** is a collection of connectivity datasets gathered on the IoT-LAB sites. These datasets are:
* **dense in time**: connectivity is continuously assessed over long periods of time;
* **dense in space**: connectivity is assessed over hundreds of measurements points;
* **dense in frequency**: connectivity is assessed for each of the 16 IEEE802.15.4 frequencies.
